# Java-Projects


1. **Decode-RLE:**
   - Description: This project is a tool for decoding data encoded using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compression algorithm.
     RLE is a simple form of data compression that replaces sequences of the same data value with a single value and a count.
     Your program takes RLE-encoded data as input and decodes it to reveal the original data.
   
2. **Rectangle Plotter:**
   - Description: The Rectangle Plotter is a program that allows users to draw rectangle along positive x and y axises of graph.
     Users can specify the position and dimensions of rectangle and interactively create it. This project is a simple application to understand user interactions.

3. **Search and Sorting:**
   - Description: This project involves implementing searching and sorting algorithms.
     Searching algorithms help find specific items in a collection (e.g., an array), while sorting algorithms arrange items in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending).

4. **Tic-Tac-Toe:**
   - Description: Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to get three of your marks (usually "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid.
     This Java project simulates the game, allows players to make moves, and checks for win conditions. It's a great project for learning about game logic and user interactions.

5. **Guess the Number:**
   - Description: "Guess the Number" is a simple number guessing game where the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess it.
     The program provides hints (higher/lower) until the player guesses correctly. It's an excellent project for practicing random number generation, conditional statements, and user input handling.

6. **Draw the Shapes:**
   - Description: This project involves drawing basic shapes like squares and triangles. Users can select a shape, specify its properties (e.g., size), and draw it.
     It's a practical project for learning about programming and handling user-drawn shapes.

These projects cover a range of programming concepts and skills, from basic user interactions to algorithms and game logic. They're a great way to develop your Java programming abilities.
